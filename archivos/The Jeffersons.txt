Stan Marsh
[stops and looks at a house] Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. [the other boys stop and look.]
Kyle Broflovski
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
Eric Cartman
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. [a door is heard opening]
Kyle Broflovski
[points] Hey Look!
Blanket Jackson
Hello!
Kyle Broflovski
Hey. Do you live here?
Blanket Jackson
Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?
Eric Cartman
No.
Blanket Jackson
I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything.
Stan Marsh
What's that you're wearing?
Blanket Jackson
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
Eric Cartman
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.
Blanket Jackson
Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
Eric Cartman
Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. [they turn away.]
Blanket Jackson
We have arcade games inside.
Blanket Jackson
Dad?
Stan Marsh
Whoa. Dude, no way!
Eric Cartman
Oh my God, this is awesome! [runs up to a claw machine]
Stan Marsh
Dude, are these all your toys?
Blanket Jackson
No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
Kyle Broflovski
Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?
Blanket Jackson
He's retired now.
Eric Cartman
[guiding the machine's arm to grab a plush toy] Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
Blanket Jackson
Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. [guides the other three boys out]
Eric Cartman
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
Blanket Jackson
Dad? You out here?
Michael Jackson
Here I am, Blanket!
Michael Jackson
Heeee!
Michael Jackson
Jeh chabee durtah!
Michael Jackson
Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
Kyle Broflovski
[softly] What's wrong with his face?
Stan Marsh
[softly] Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
Blanket Jackson
Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-
Michael Jackson
Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?
Michael Jackson
Come on, let's climb the tree! [turns to a tree and scales it] Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree!
Michael Jackson
Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key.
Kyle Broflovski
Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.
Michael Jackson
Won't you imagine along with me?
Kyle Broflovski
Mr. Jefferson?
Michael Jackson
We can be spacemen, 
or pirates on the sea
Chuckajamonah!
Yes we can do everything,
and I mean, everything!
Chuckajamonah!
Up in my Wishing Tree!
Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
Stan Marsh
Hey, you guys! You guys! [the kids gather around] You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
Red
The Jeffersons?
Eric Cartman
[breathless] They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! [his chest heaves noticeably]
Kyle Broflovski
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
Eric Cartman
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
Craig Tucker
[in a monotone voice] No way.
Eric Cartman
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
Craig Tucker
[not wanting to be left out] I believe in Mr. Jefferson!
Michael Jackson
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!
Blanket Jackson
Who wants the first cotton candy?
Kids
Memememememememememe
Michael Jackson
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!
Michael Jackson
Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
Eric Cartman
Choo-choo train! Yay!
Michael Jackson
Let's ride the train! The train!
Michael Jackson
Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?
Eric Cartman
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
Michael Jackson
Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.
Eric Cartman
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
Michael Jackson
Let's ride and ride on the train together
Eric Cartman
...Train together
Michael Jackson
On a journey through both of our minds.
Eric Cartman
I've got time. Do youuu??
Kyle Broflovski
Dude, what happened to your knee?
Blanket Jackson
[his skinned knee is shown] I fell down.
Kyle Broflovski
[calls out] Mr. Jefferson!
Michael Jackson
[back on the train] Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.
Eric Cartman
Choo-choo train.
Kyle Broflovski
Mr-Â ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. [takes Blanket inside]
Kyle Broflovski
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.
Blanket Jackson
Ow!
Kyle Broflovski
I know, I know. Be cool.
Blanket Jackson
Thank you. That already feels better.
Kyle Broflovski
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Blanket Jackson
I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
Kyle Broflovski
And where is your mom?
Blanket Jackson
I don't have a mom.
Kyle Broflovski
You must have a mom.
Kyle Broflovski
You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
Blanket Jackson
No. I was made in a laboratory.
Kyle Broflovski
What?
Blanket Jackson
My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
Kyle Broflovski
So you never met your mom?
Blanket Jackson
No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
Kyle Broflovski
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
Eric Cartman
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
Kyle Broflovski
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Eric Cartman
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
Kyle Broflovski
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
Eric Cartman
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! [faces Kyle down] Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! [turns and walks away angrily]
Randy Marsh
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
Stan Marsh
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
Sharon Marsh
Oh, are they nice people?
Stan Marsh
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
Sharon Marsh
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
Gerald Broflovski
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
Michael Jackson
Kentucky, yeah.
Randy Marsh
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
Michael Jackson
No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant.
Stephen Stotch
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?
Michael Jackson
Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals
Sheila Broflovski
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
Michael Jackson
I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.
Randy Marsh
....Yeeeah.
Sharon Marsh
...They are fun. [glances back, away from the table] Boys, you okay out there?
Stan Marsh
Fine, Mom.
Blanket Jackson
Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
Kyle Broflovski
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
Blanket Jackson
Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.
Eric Cartman
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
Stan Marsh
No, my parents are.
Eric Cartman
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
Stan Marsh
What?
Eric Cartman
He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, [Stan steps back...] and I-
Eric Cartman
Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
Gerald Broflovski
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
Randy Marsh
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
Michael Jackson
[taken aback] D'huh?
Stephen Stotch
I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
Michael Jackson
I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
Gerald Broflovski
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
Michael Jackson
Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
Harris
Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.
Harrison Yates
[disregards the sheet] Whatcha got?
Harris
Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money.
Harrison Yates
So, what's the problem?
Harris
Take a look. Says here... [the sergeant takes the sheet and reviews it] He's black.
Harrison Yates
By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.
Harrison Yates
Let's go people!
Harrison Yates
We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!
Stan Marsh
[looks out] Kyle?
Michael Jackson
Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'? [dances a little]
Stan Marsh
Mr. Jefferson Awww! [hops off the bed] It's 1:30 in the morning!
Michael Jackson
Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.
Michael Jackson
T-shamon!
I'm a little boy forever.
Michael Jackson
Hey!
Stan Marsh
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Eric Cartman
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
Stan Marsh
He just showed up here.
Eric Cartman
Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. [a knock is heard at Stan's door]
Stan Marsh
Jesus Christ!
Kyle Broflovski
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
Blanket Jackson
[wearing his veil] Hi, Stan.
Kyle Broflovski
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
Stan Marsh
I know. He's here.
Kyle Broflovski
What?!
Michael Jackson
Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!
Stan Marsh
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
Michael Jackson
We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
Blanket Jackson
Dad says it wants to eat us.
Michael Jackson
Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!
Blanket Jackson
We're scared!
Mr Jefferson
Hee hee!
Stan Marsh
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Kyle Broflovski
Come on, Blanket.
Michael Jackson
Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight
Eric Cartman
Deeper.
Eric Cartman
Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
Michael Jackson
I think you're awesome too, Cartman.
Eric Cartman
Yeah?
Michael Jackson
Yeah.
Eric Cartman
Yeah?
Michael Jackson
Yeah.
Eric Cartman
Yeah?
Stan Marsh
Ahaa!
Michael Jackson
[wakes up] What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?
Stan Marsh
Yeah. A really bad dream.
Stan Marsh
Oh Jesus!
Harrison Yates
[using his walkie-talkie] Murphy, you inside?
Detective Murphy
[walking through the arcade room] We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!
Detective Murphy
I'm planting the cocaine now.
Harrison Yates
Johnson, what about you?
Johnson
[in a closet] Placing the blood spatter now, sir. [right on a pair of Jefferson's shoes]
Harrison Yates
Frakes?
Frakes
Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir.
Harrison Yates
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras. [sighs] Why do we do it, Harris?
Harris
Sir?
Harrison Yates
Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
Harris
Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.
Harrison Yates
Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
Randy Marsh
Stan, time to get up for school. [opens the door and looks in] Stan? What the-? [sees the five people in bed] Mr. Jefferson?!
Michael Jackson
[sits up quickly] Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party.
Randy Marsh
Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!
Michael Jackson
Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.
Michael Jackson
Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. [gives each of them 100 dollar bills]
Randy Marsh
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. [leaves, and Sharon watches him go]
Michael Jackson
Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. [quickly leaves with Blanket in tow]
Sharon Marsh
Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
Stan Marsh
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
Eric Cartman
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! [Stan, Kyle, and Sharon are shocked]
Michael Jackson
Come on, Blanket!
Harrison Yates
Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!
Harris
[walks] Wha- wha- what?
Harrison Yates
It's Jefferson! He's back! [gets on his communicator] All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.
Harrison Yates
Whoa, wait a minute! [withdraws his gun] That guy isn't black!
Harrison Yates
Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus! [gets on his communicator] This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!
Harrison Yates
You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!
Harris
It says right here on the final sheet he is!
Harrison Yates
[shoves Harris's face against the windshield] Does that look like a black guy to you?!
Harris
It said on the final sheet!
Harrison Yates
[throws a fit] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!
Harrison Yates
Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.
Harrison Yates
Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?
Harris
Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it.
Harrison Yates
[whips around and says menacingly] To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
Michael Jackson
All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!
Kyle Broflovski
[stops] That poor kid.
Stan Marsh
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.
Blanket Jackson
[opens his windows as they approach] Hi guys!
Kyle Broflovski
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
Blanket Jackson
Really? You mean it?
Michael Jackson
[interrupts, clapping] Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!
Stan Marsh
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
Michael Jackson
Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!
Stan Marsh
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
Michael Jackson
Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket? [picks him up and moves him around through the open window] Wee, look! He can fly!
Kyle Broflovski
[the boys fear for Blanket's life] Jesus Christ, dude!
Blanket Jackson
Aaaaaah! [Mr. Jefferson dangles him around by his left foot]
Stan Marsh
Stop, you fucking lunatic! [Mr. Jefferson's moustache falls off and down to the ground, he pulls Blanket back inside and closes the window]
Kyle Broflovski
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
Michael Jackson
No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.
Michael Jackson
Jeekabee durtah! [a kick and outstretched arm] Ow!
Michael Jackson
There, Blanket, shhhh. [tries to distract Blanket] Hey, hey look, hey look.
Michael Jackson
I got your nose. [does it again.] Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See?
Blanket Jackson
Aaaaaaaah! [throws it away and runs out of his bedroom]
Michael Jackson
No, Blanket, stop!
Michael Jackson
It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
Maggie Yates
Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry.
Harrison Yates
I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force.
Maggie Yates
Quitting the force? You?
Harrison Yates
None of it makes sense anymore. [sits down and unloads his frustrations] I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired.
Maggie Yates
[approaches and consoles him] Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates. [he looks up at her] Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you. [she caresses him, he kisses her hand]
Harrison Yates
And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. [abruptly rises and goes to the coat rack]
Maggie Yates
Where're you goin'?
Harrison Yates
Think I've got a little more work to do. [puts on his coat and heads outside]
Eric Cartman
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Michael Jackson
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!
Michael Jackson
I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!
Michael Jackson
But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!
Michael Jackson
Oh, I'm melting!
Kyle Broflovski
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
Kenny McCormick
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Stan Marsh
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
Kenny McCormick
Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
Kyle Broflovski
[seething as he climbs the ladder] I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! [Stan and Kenny follow]
Stan Marsh
Blanket, you in here?
Blanket Jackson
[excited] Hi guys!
Kyle Broflovski
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? [Kenny looks around]
Blanket Jackson
You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Stan Marsh
All right dude, get in his bed.
Kenny McCormick
[gets under the covers] All right, but you guys owe me for this.
Stan Marsh
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. [hops off and leaves]
Sgt. Snetzl
Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.
Harrison Yates
Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.
Sgt. Snetzl
Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?
Harrison Yates
Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?
Sgt. Snetzl
Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.
Harrison Yates
Well, he doesn't really look that black.
Sgt. Snetzl
Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial.
Harrison Yates
You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
Sgt. Snetzl
We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges.
Harrison Yates
Molestation, nice.
Sgt. Snetzl
Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarrassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!
Harrison Yates
That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.
Sgt. Snetzl
Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.
Harrison Yates
[rises from his chair. Other officers draw near] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
Eric Cartman
Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
Kyle Broflovski
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us.
Michael Jackson
What are you doing with my Blanket?
Michael Jackson
Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! [an outstretched arm]
Stan Marsh
Haaaaa!
Kyle Broflovski
Haaaaa!
Blanket Jackson
Haaaaa!
Stan Marsh
Go, go, ruuun! [the boys run out of the bathroom]
Mr Jefferson
[whispers as he walks] Sutah!
Stan Marsh
Haaaaa!
Kyle Broflovski
Haaaaa!
Blanket Jackson
Haaaaa!
Michael Jackson
[rounds a corner onto the hallway] Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!
Stan Marsh
[The boys enter Blanket's room] Oh Jesus!
Kenny McCormick
What the hell is going on, you guys?
Michael Jackson
[enters and heads for Blanket's bed] My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket! [pulls Kenny out of the bed]
Kenny McCormick
Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!
Michael Jackson
[tossing Kenny up into the air] Wee, he can fly! He can fly!
Kenny McCormick
Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-
Stan Marsh
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
Kyle Broflovski
You bastard!
Michael Jackson
Blanket? Blanket! Come play! [slowly approaches the boys]
Blanket Jackson
Nooo! [Stan turns to leave]
Kyle Broflovski
[grabs Blanket's hand and leaves as well] Come on!
Stan Marsh
Run, Blanket, Run!
Blanket Jackson
[stumbles] Ah!
Michael Jackson
[exits] Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!
Kyle Broflovski
[Kyle and Stan help Blanket up] Hang on, Blanket!
Mr Jefferson
[shielding his eyes] Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!
Harrison Yates
[through his bullhorn] Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!
Eric Cartman
[hops to Mr. Jefferson's defense, standing in front of him] No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! [a crowd, including the boys' parents, gathers] All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
Michael Jackson
It's ignorant.
Eric Cartman
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
Kyle Broflovski
[returns with Blanket] All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!
Kyle Broflovski
Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
Michael Jackson
[closeup for a few seconds] You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh. [genuflects behind Blanket] Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting.
Blanket Jackson
Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
Harrison Yates
[approaches with Harris] Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.
Kyle Broflovski
All right! Things just might work out!
Michael Jackson
Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
Michael Jackson
We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!
