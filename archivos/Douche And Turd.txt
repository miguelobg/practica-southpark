Cheerleaders
We are South Park, Green and White. Let's go, Cows! Fight, fight, fight! Nobody can beat a Cow! Let's gooo, South Park![in the audience, Cartman yawns.]
Red
Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?
Students
[all grades] Moooooooo!
Bebe Stevens
I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?
Mandy
[new fourth grader, with braces that makes her speak with a lisp] Yeah, and South Park is really gonna stick it to Littleton next week!
Bebe Stevens
Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! [an adult in a cow suit comes out, waves to the kids, then begins to dance.]
Butters Stotch
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Eric Cartman
Butters, shut the hell up! [As Mooey dances, PETA bursts in through the double doors and rushes towards the cheerleaders. They apprehend Mooey and begin beating him up, then pulling his head off]
Blonde PETA Woman
[through her megaphone] We are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals! We protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot!
Herbert Garrison
Oh, Jesus, not PETA again.
Dreadlocked PETA Man
[approaches Bebe] Cows are maimed and slaughtered and used as a commodity! [throws a bucket of real blood on Bebe. Other PETA members go after the rest of the cheerleaders]
Blonde PETA Woman
[showing old slaughterhouse scenes on how to prepare beef] This is the fate of the cow! This is your insensitivity!
Students
Ewww! [a kindergartner begins to cry]
Gas Mask PETA Member
The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong!
Herbert Garrison
All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot.
Class
Awwwwwwww!
Stan Marsh
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
Herbert Garrison
That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win. [approaches the students with a stack of papers and begins distributing it] Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot.
Clyde Donovan
But we like being the Cows! [a bucket of real blood is doused on him and the rest of the class gasps.]
Dreadlocked PETA man
You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions!
Herbert Garrison
[taking action] Ge-get outta here, PETA! We're changin' the mascot already!
Dreadlocked PETA man
Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?!
Herbert Garrison
[throws some papers at the PETA member] Oh, ge-get outta here! [breaks out a can of mace and sprays it on him] Ge-get out! [the man leaves] Jesus, where do they keep coming from?! [sprays some more for effect] Go on, get outta here.
Stan Marsh
This is bullcrap, dude!
Herbert Garrison
Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians...
Wendy Testaburger
But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
Herbert Garrison
No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.
Eric Cartman
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Kyle Broflovski
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
Eric Cartman
Ye-heah!
Kenny McCormick
(Yeah, totally awesome!)
Eric Cartman
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
Kyle Broflovski
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
Eric Cartman
Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
Kyle Broflovski
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
Eric Cartman
It is not!
Kyle Broflovski
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
Kenny McCormick
(Giant douche.)
Eric Cartman
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
Kyle Broflovski
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Stan Marsh
Dude, I really don't care. [walks away]
Kyle Broflovski
[tallies the votes. Behind him, Butters approaches his locker and prepares to open it] That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
Eric Cartman
[notices, then runs to Butters and pulls him towards the other boys] ...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
Butters Stotch
Huh?
Kyle Broflovski
You hate Butters.
Eric Cartman
Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
Butters Stotch
Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
Kyle Broflovski
You misled him, fatass!
Eric Cartman
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
Butters Stotch
[crosses his arms] Yeah! ...What's this for? [the boys approach Jimmy]
Kyle Broflovski
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
Jimmy Valmer
That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
Kyle Broflovski
A giant douche.
Jimmy Valmer
Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
Eric Cartman
A turd sandwich.
Jimmy Valmer
Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds. [ten seconds pass] Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?
Kyle Broflovski
Giant douche.
Jimmy Valmer
[snickers] And the second?
Eric Cartman
Turd sandwich.
Jimmy Valmer
[snickers] Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds.[ten seconds pass] All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
Kyle Broflovski
A giant douche.
Jimmy Valmer
[snickers] Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?
Eric Cartman
Turd sandwich.
Jimmy Valmer
[snickers] Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
Eric Cartman
Awwwww!
Butters Stotch
Ohhh, we lost?
Kyle Broflovski
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Eric Cartman
Okay. You win, Kyle.
Herbert Garrison
Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche. [a giant douche steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to 2 Unlimited's "Get ready for this."]
Kyle Broflovski
Go, giant douche!
Kenny McCormick
Go, giant douche!
Giant Douche
Hey, South Park! Have we got school spirit?! [a smattering of applause] We've got spirit, yes we do! Giant douches, me and you! Let's gooooo, Douches! [a smaller smattering of applause]
Herbert Garrison
And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. [a turd sandwich steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to Baha Men's "Who Let The Dogs Out?"]
Eric Cartman
All right turd sandwich!
Butters Stotch
Yeah!
Kyle Broflovski
Cartman? What the hell?!
Eric Cartman
Giant Douche sucks!
Turd Sandwich
We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh! [a smattering of applause]
Herbert Garrison
Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
Kyle Broflovski
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Eric Cartman
Game on, Jew-boy!
Butters Stotch
Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! [looks at Cartman, smiles, and looks back at Kyle]
Kyle Broflovski
Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
Kenny McCormick
(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
Kyle Broflovski
Giant Douche is your man!
Stan Marsh
[exiting] Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
Kyle Broflovski
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. [something like an ice cream truck is heard, and Cartman appears driving his Big Wheels bike, pulling a portable stage. Butters is dancing on the stage, dressed as a Hawaiian hula dancer. In his hands he has leis to hand out.]
Eric Cartman
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives. [Butters begins tossing out the leis, and kids step forth to get them. A man shows up as well, but gets nothing] Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
Kyle Broflovski
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
Stan Marsh
I'm not voting!
Kyle Broflovski
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
Stan Marsh
I just think this whole thing is stupid! [walks off angrily]
Kyle Broflovski
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
Kenny McCormick
(Yeah.)
Sharon Marsh
How was school today, Stanley?
Stan Marsh
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Sharon Marsh
...What did you say?
Randy Marsh
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
Stan Marsh
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
Randy Marsh
[clenches his fists] You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
Sharon Marsh
Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
Stan Marsh
Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
Randy Marsh
[jumps upright and plants his hands on the table] You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
Sharon Marsh
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
Randy Marsh
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
Sharon Marsh
It's sexist, is what it is!
Randy Marsh
You don't understand the issues, Sharon!
Sharon Marsh
Are you calling me ignorant?!
Randy Marsh
You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
Sharon Marsh
I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! [picks up the casserole and chucks it at Randy, who ducks and looks back at her angrily. They both leave the table in opposite directions.]
Shelly Marsh
[leaving the table as well] I hate this family, I hate it! [Stan looks on, shocked, while Marvin continues eating unruffled. The door bell rings. Stan leaves the table and opens the front door. A black man is outside... with his posse]
Stan Marsh
Puff Daddy?
Puff Daddy
Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.
Stan Marsh
I...
Puff Daddy
Apparently, you haven't heard of my "Vote or Die" campaign. [holds up a shirt with the slogan on it]
Stan Marsh
"Vote or Die"? [upset] What the hell does that even mean?!
Puff Daddy
[whips out a gun from his back pocket, cocks it, and aims it at Stan] What you think it means, bitch!
Stan Marsh
Aaaah!
Posse
Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!
Puff Daddy
Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye.
Posse
Democracy is founded on one simple rule!
Puff Daddy
Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you.Yeah.
Puff Daddy
I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
[seated as two women dance for him, their asses in his face]
I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof)
[gently spanks a woman as she goes in to vote]
Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth.
[Fish-eye overhead view of Puff Daddy. He shoves his gun into the camera]
I said vote, bitch, or I'll fucking kill you!
Posse
Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!
Puff Daddy
You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!
Posse
Let your opinion be heard! You gotta make a choice
Puff Daddy
'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice [Stan runs again, looking behind him, but runs into a gun in his face]
