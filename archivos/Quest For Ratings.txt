This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, Super School News. The news made for students, by students.
Jimmy Valmer
Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
Eric Cartman
And I'm Rick Cartman.
Jimmy Valmer
The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
Eric Cartman
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
Stan Marsh
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
Eric Cartman
[serious pose] ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
Butters Stotch
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
Eric Cartman
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
Butters Stotch
[over a speaker] Will do.
Jimmy Valmer
More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
Token Black
[in front of a weather map] Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?
Eric Cartman
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Kyle Broflovski
[at a small desk, for Sports] Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
Eric Cartman
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
Jimmy Valmer
And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- [lilts] Ehehehehe [normal] El-Elementary.
Stan Marsh
[returning from the kitchen to serve as cameraman] And we're... cut! [turns off the camera]
Eric Cartman
All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. [the reporters gather in studio]
Butters Stotch
Boy, that was a great episode!
Stan Marsh
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
Mr Meryl
[enters the studio] Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show.
Kyle Broflovski
What?!
Jimmy Valmer
For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!
Mr Meryl
Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.
Eric Cartman
How many students is that?
Mr Meryl
Four. [holds up four fingers] Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!
Stan Marsh
...Craig's show??
Eric Cartman
What is that butthole doing now?!
Mr Meryl
Oh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens. [pops a VHS tape into the player and the video starts]
Craig Tucker
[on tape, as the name of the show is displayed] Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. [the video goes on to show close-ups of dogs and cats.]
Stan Marsh
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
Mr Meryl
It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids. [walks between and past them]
Jimmy Valmer
[stopping Mr. Meryl] But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.
Mr Meryl
Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!
Eric Cartman
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
Mr Meryl
I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay. [walks off]
Eric Cartman
...You're gay!
Butters Stotch
[his head resting on his right hand] Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
Stan Marsh
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
Whistlin Willy
[approaches the table] Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'? [begins to whistle]
Eric Cartman
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
Whistlin Willy
[enthusiastically] If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle. [whistles] Come on! [whistles some more, then stops. The boys whistle back, but slowly and flatly] There you go! [sets the pizza down on the table and leaves]
Eric Cartman
[softly] God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
Stan Marsh
[look at Cartman, but notices someone else] Hey, look, Craig just walked in. [Craig enters to cheers from the other kids in the restaurant and waves back to them. Several kids take pictures of Craig]
Bradley
Yeah!
Kid 1
Hey look, it's Craig!
Kevin
Hey, Craig, over here!
Kyle Broflovski
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Craig Tucker
[sees the other boys and addresses them] Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
Eric Cartman
Go play with yourself, Craig.
Craig Tucker
Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.
Stan Marsh
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! [holds up a fist with thumb and index finger just a centimeter apart]
Craig Tucker
[throws the gesture back at Stan] This much more than you had!
Craig Tucker
Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! [the other kids cheer and the waiter opens the lounge. The kids pour into place, including Kenny.]
Kenny McCormick
(Woohoo!)
Eric Cartman
[catches up to Kenny] Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
Kenny McCormick
(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
