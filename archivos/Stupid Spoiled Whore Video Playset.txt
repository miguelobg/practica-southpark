Bebe Stevens
Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!
Wendy Testaburger
We're gonna miss what?
Bebe Stevens
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
Wendy Testaburger
Who's Paris Hilton?
Red
"Who's Paris Hilton?"
Annie Knitts
You don't know?
Announcer
[someone takes a picture as he approaches the mic.] Hello, everyone! The Guess Clothing Company is pleased to have as its new spokesperson model, a woman all you young ones can look up to, Ms. Paris Hilton. [she appears and flashbulbs go off amid squeals from females in the crowd. She then lifts her bra and shows off her breasts]
Bebe Stevens
Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!
Wendy Testaburger
I don't get it. What's she do?
Annie Knitts
She's super-rich!
Wendy Testaburger
...But what does she do?
Red
She's totally spoiled and snobby.
Wendy Testaburger
[annoyed] What does she do?!
Man
[walks by and overhears] She's a whore. [takes his camera and snaps a few pictures]
Paris Hilton
[her left eyelid hangs heavy] Hey everyone. Sorry if I'm a little spent. I did a whole lot of partying last night with a LOT of different guys. [coughs semen onto her left fist] Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Gouth Dark to announce the opening of my brand new store! A store where girls can buy everything they need to be just like me! Stupid Spoiled Whore! [the red curtain drops to reveal the store. The crowd cheers] Have fun, girls. And remember to party, and be super-lame to everybody. G'Bye! [steps aside and off-stage. An assistant awaits with water and a tote bag, which has a Chihuahua in it. She holds out a bottle of water] Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink! [vomits out feces, then drinks from the bottle. The assistant arms her with the tote bag] Where's my dog?! [walks off]
Bebe Stevens
Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls.
Red
[walks up to a display case] Hey, check it out: the new Paris Hilton perfume, Skanque. [grins and holds a heart-shaped bottle with the name on it]
Announcer
Skanque.
Annie Knitts
[carrying some clothes] Oh yeah, let's get lots of that!
Wendy Testaburger
You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
Red
It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!
Wendy Testaburger
But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
Bebe Stevens
[now with two armloads of clothes] Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!
Annie Knitts
Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe.
Bebe Stevens
Thanks, Annie! [She, Annie, and Red walk away, and Wendy remains stunned]
Paris Hilton
[quickly arrives and enters the limo] God, get me out of this hick town! What a bunch of rednecks! [the driver closes the door, starts up the limo, and drives off. Inside, she picks up her Chihuahua and starts talking to it, caressing it] Everybody's so fucking lame. Except for you, my little Tinkerbell. You love my vewy much, don't you? How much you wuv me? I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny, and then I'm gonna dress you up like a little princess. You're mine forever! [her cellphone rings and she answers it, releasing Tinkerbell.] Whatever! Oh, hey, Kasey. Oh, another stupid store opening at some lame cowboy town. [Tinkerbell jumps down from the seat and walks away dejected] Oh, it's so fucking stupid, this whole town stinks like cows. [Tinkerbell is up on the divider and looks down] I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!
Paris Hilton
They have the lamest stores, too. [... walks over to the driver and digs around his right coat pocket ...] I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend, I think. I dunno, Rome or Tokyo, either way it'll be totally boring. [... and digs out a small gun from the pocket.] Stupid. [coughs some semen onto her left hand] Hagh. [Tinkerbell carries the gun back to the back seat...] I need to get wasted. I haven't had a drink in like fourteen minutes. Why is everybody so stupid anyway? [... and sets the gun down long enough to put the barrel against its chin. Tinkerbell then tries to set the gun off with her right hind leg. That doesn't work, so she stands the gun up on its butt and tries again] I flashed all these hicks with my boobs; you should've seen the look on their faces! Stupid redneck idiots!
Paris Hilton
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Paris Hilton's Chauffeur
Oh dear...
Paris Hilton
Another dog killed itself!
Wendy Testaburger
Hey Jessie [the blonde], Hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.
Jessie
Sure, Wendy. We were just trying to think of something to do.
Wendy Testaburger
Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
Jessie
Nah, that sounds really dull.
Kal
Hey, I know! Let's make a videotape of us having sex with boys! [Jessie likes the idea]
Wendy Testaburger
What?!
Kal
I just got [brings out a box] the Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset! [the set comes from Letcher Price and "Makes you a whore and so much more!"]
Singers
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset!
Kal
You can make videos that get out on the Internet!
Jessie
Yeah! [Kal puts on some makeup as Jessie looks on]
Singers
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Show the whole world what a slut you are!
Announcer
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset comes with video camera, night-vision filter, play money, cellphone, and sixteen hits of ecstasy. [nine hits are shown] [The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]
Singers
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Let everyone see your coo-ooch!

[The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]
Kal
I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cellphone while my man waits for more sex!
Jessie
You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore. [Wendy just turns right and walks away.] Where are you goin', Wendy?
Paris Hilton
Bwaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaa!
Paris Hilton's Chauffeur
All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog.
Paris Hilton
[throws a tantrum] Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Driver
There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?
Paris Hilton
Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo... [notices something outside] Wait! Wait, stop the car! [the limo proceeds] Stop the car, you fucking moron! [the limo stops] Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want that!
Butters Stotch
[playing with some apples on a checkerboard blanket on the front lawn] 
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
Paris Hilton
It's adorable! [exits the limo and closes the door]
Butters Stotch
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo![Paris approaches him]
Paris Hilton
Look at his wittle puff ball! [Butters is surprised] I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you, and call you Mr. Biggles! [kneels down and hugs him]
Butters Stotch
My name's Butters.
Paris Hilton
Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car. [the driver appears] I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?
Paris Hilton's Chauffeur
Paris, I believe this is somebody's child.
Paris Hilton
I want it!
Paris Hilton's Chauffeur
I don't think you can actually-
Paris Hilton
I want it! I want it! [rocks back and forth]
Paris Hilton's Chauffeur
All right, all right, come on- come on, young man.
Butters Stotch
Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Paris Hilton
Well did they say anything about limousines? [Butters thinks about it. An image of his parents appears]
Stephen Stotch
Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.
Butters Stotch
Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
Paris Hilton
[happily] Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles! We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!
Announcer
And now, back to The Price is Right! [Wendy sighs]
Dad
Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
Wendy Testaburger
Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.
Dad
Oh?
Wendy Testaburger
It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
Dad
...Gosh.
Wendy Testaburger
I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
Dad
Well, get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? [Wendy doesn't answer. Instead, she turns away and walks off slowly, and her parents go back to eating chips]
Wendy Testaburger
[spins around and walks back] Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!
Dad
[suddenly angered] What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!
Mr Testaburger
Oh my God! Well this place is-! Oh my God! [approaches a line of girls and their mothers.] Mrs. Knitts, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!
Mrs Knitts
[giggles] It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my little girl be the only one not in a trend; she'll be unpopular.
Mr Testaburger
Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?! [Bebe and her mom now pay attention] But these are our girls!
Mrs Stevens
I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's normal, but if a woman wants to be one, it's wrong. [the other females murmur in agreement]
Woman 1
Yeah, when a man pees standing up, it's normal, but when a woman does it, it's weird.
Females
Yeah! Right!
Woman 2
Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's straaange.
Females
Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!
Teen Girl 1
All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it.
Teen Girl 2
[rubs her ass up against Mr. Testaburger] Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore.
Mr Testaburger
[more amenable now] Oh, uh sure I can buy a purse.
Wendy Testaburger
Dad!
Mr Testaburger
Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard. [enjoying the affection] Oh yeah. I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!
Females
Hooray!
Stephen Stotch
Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!
Butters Stotch
[dressed in a bear cub outfit] Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
Stephen Stotch
Your girlfriend?
Paris Hilton
[enters the scene] There you are, Mr. Biggles! [picks Butters up and hugs him] Aw, I thought I'd lost you! [caresses him] Promise you'll never leave me. [his parents are stunned]
Linda Stotch
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton? You are grounded, mister!
Butters Stotch
I'm sorry.
Stephen Stotch
[turns his wife around] Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?
Linda Stotch
Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!
Stephen Stotch
Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! [they turn around]
Linda Stotch
Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? [Paris coughs some semen onto her left hand and rubs it against the rug]
Paris Hilton
With schnapps and Scotch. [coughs some more semen onto her hand]
Stephen Stotch
So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.
Paris Hilton
I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.
Linda Stotch
[stunned again] With you where?
Paris Hilton
To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?
Linda Stotch
How much? For Butters?
Stephen Stotch
Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
Paris Hilton
I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it. [Butters is afraid. Chris spits out his cocoa and puts down his cup]
Stephen Stotch
Excuse me?!
Paris Hilton
I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it! [Chris spits out his cocoa. Linda does so as well. Paris whips out a checkbook and pen] I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now.
Linda Stotch
Chris, is she serious?
Stephen Stotch
Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.
Butters Stotch
[while Paris writes out a check] Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
Stephen Stotch
Butters, right now!
Linda Stotch
We aren't honestly considering this?
Stephen Stotch
Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.
Linda Stotch
But he's our son!
Stephen Stotch
I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.
Linda Stotch
The rest of the f- you do mean us?
Stephen Stotch
Yes, us, the rest of the family.
Paris Hilton
What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much. [falls backward upon the bad] Oh my God, I'm so wasted! [her genitals are exposed] The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out. [she falls silent. Butters looks around, then reaches over with his left hand and touches her vagina a few times]
Wendy Testaburger
Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
Bebe Stevens
You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
Wendy Testaburger
I'm a stupid spoiled whore. [her dress is relaxed: blue jeans and turquoise tank top with one strap over the right shoulder. The girls laugh at her reply]
Annie Knitts
Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff!
Red
Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!
Bebe Stevens
You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
Red
You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle, and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine.
Wendy Testaburger
That's okay.
Annie Knitts
Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is?
Wendy Testaburger
Yes.
Annie Knitts
See? You are too smart.
Red
Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.
Bebe Stevens
Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
Various Teen Girls
Yeah. [Wendy turns around and walks off sadly. The others laugh at her, then move on to other topics]
Red
Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.
Sally Turner
Oooo, look, here comes Clyde.
Bebe Stevens
Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. [Clyde walks by, wondering what these girls are on about]
Millie Larsen
Mmm, I'd like a piece of that!
Red
I wanna do him.
Annie Knitts
Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle. [Cartman, still at his locker, looks over. Kyle passes by]
Sally Turner
Mmm, talk to me, kosher boy. [Cartman turns around to see what the girls see]
Millie Larsen
I'd like to twizel his pixie stick.
Bebe Stevens
Party at my house tonight, Kyle.
Annie Knitts
Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way. [Tweek and Jason walk by]
Red
Yeah, they're invited too.
Sally Turner
Jason has a huge bulge. You're gonna get it, boys.
Bebe Stevens
Now here's what I'm talking about. [Token appears and walks by] A little midnight blue!
Millie Larsen
Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft!
Annie Knitts
Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven! [Cartman clears his throat, closes his locker, and walks past the girls. Not one of them says a thing.]
Sally Turner
Look, here comes Kevin. [Kevin appears and walks by]
Bebe Stevens
Hey Kevin, party at my house.
Millie Larsen
I'd like to gargle his marbles.
Red
Yeah, you said it. [Cartman runs back along the hall in such a way that the girls don't notice]
Sally Turner
See you there, Kev. [Cartman tries again, and the girls notice.]
Eric Cartman
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure." [the girls say nothing. Cartman stops, gets angry, and walks back to the first girl he saw, then flips each one of them off. He flips Red off with both hands.] Fuck you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! [leaves.]
Butters Stotch
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. [upon hearing a knock on the door, he gasps and stops probing Paris]
Stephen Stotch
Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.
Paris Hilton
[awakens and sits up] Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small!
Stephen Stotch
Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars. [Butters smiles] It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front.
Butters Stotch
Oh hamburgers!
Paris Hilton
Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!
Butters Stotch
[jumps off the bed and runs to Linda] Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! [the parents look at each other]
Stephen Stotch
All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.
Butters Stotch
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
Stephen Stotch
It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!
Butters Stotch
Y-yes sir! [rushes out of the room] I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
Stephen Stotch
[to Linda] That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? [they both grin]
Millie Larsen
[stands next to the closet while a crowd of girls looks on] Okay, that's two minutes. You can come out, Clyde, Bab. [the door opens and Bab comes out grinning] How was he, Bab?
Bab
[winks at Clyde] We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?
Clyde Donovan
[walks out crying with his hands rubbing his butt] Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. [a knock is heard at the front door and Red goes to answer it.]
Eric Cartman
[dressed very casually, with hair slightly unkempt] Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
Red
[not fooled] Yeah? Who invited you?
Eric Cartman
Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
Red
Kelly who?
Eric Cartman
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
Red
[looks over her shoulder and calls out] Kelly Rutherfordmenskin?
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin
[approaches the door] Yeah?
Red
Did you invite him?
Kelly Menskin
No! [goes back inside. Red closes the door on Cartman]
Eric Cartman
Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
Red
[turns around and calls out] Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
[sharing a wading pool with Token and Heidi] What? [Red glares at Cartman]
Eric Cartman
[under his breath] Oh, Goddammit!
Herbert Garrison
Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right?
Wendy Testaburger
No, I need help.
Herbert Garrison
F-from from me?
Wendy Testaburger
Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.
Herbert Garrison
Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here. [the camera follows them over to Mr. Slave, who's dangling from the ceiling like a marionette. He's moaning in pleasure]
Mr Slave
Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!
Herbert Garrison
Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you.
Mr Slave
Oh, Hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?
Wendy Testaburger
No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you
Herbert Garrison
...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa.
Wendy Testaburger
Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
Mr Slave
Thank you sweetie.
Wendy Testaburger
Can you teach me your secret fast?
Mr Slave
Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember. [a shot of the toddler Slave crawling around on a bed] Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things.
Little Slave
Mommy, I think I have a fever. Can you take my temperature? [his mom approaches and sticks a thermometer up his butt] Oooo, Jesus Christ. [grins]
Mr Slave
As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.
Boy Slave
[sees a football practice and fakes a call] Hey, there's that queer kid. Let's tackle him! [holds out his arms and waits for the tackle]
Kid
Hey yeah, tackle the queer kid! [the players gang up on him. He seems to love the punishment] We'll show you, queer!
Boy Slave
Oooooooooooh! Oooooooooooh! Jesus Christ!
Mr Slave
So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?
Wendy Testaburger
Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
Mr Slave
A what?! For God's sake, where?!
Butters Stotch
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.[a blue car pulls up alongside and stops]
Man
Look at that. A bear, mining for coal.
Woman
Huh, I never. [the car moves on. Butters' parents, Paris, and her driver approach him]
Stephen Stotch
Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?
Butters Stotch
Well, no, not quite.
Stephen Stotch
Oh, well, too bad. [shows off the check] Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.
Butters Stotch
[throws away his shovel] Ah, shucks! [moments later he follows Paris into the limo]
Linda Stotch
Bye, sweetie, we love you!
Paris Hilton
Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet before anything happens. [snaps a picture]
Butters Stotch
Before what happens? [gets no answer, so looks around and sees her "MY PETS" photo album. He picks it up and leafs through it]
Butters Stotch
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [throws the book away, gets out of the limo as fast as he can and runs away.]
Paris Hilton
[exits the limo] Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles, come back! [Butters' parents approach] You'd better help me find him! No Mr. Biggles, no money! [takes away the check]
Chris
Oh that trouble making son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!
Mr Slave
Oh Jesus! [turns on the light] Kids, kids!
Annie Knitts
Ew, party foul!
Red
Shut off the light.
Stan Marsh
Oh, thank God.
Mr Slave
Girls, what on earth are you doing?
Bebe Stevens
We're being stupid spoiled whores. [grins]
Butters Stotch
[rushes in] H-help! You've gotta hide me! [opens the closet door and enters] Don't tell her I'm in here! [closes the door]
Bebe Stevens
What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
Mr Slave
Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!
Paris Hilton
[approaches the house and enters] Mr. Biggles!
Mr Slave
[unaware] Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife!
Paris Hilton
Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!
Bebe Stevens
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
Butters Stotch
[bolts out of the closet] HAAAAH! [Bab looks out from the closet, grinning]
Mr Slave
Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.
Paris Hilton
What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying?
Mr Slave
Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.
Paris Hilton
You don't even know what partying is, loser. [brushes him off]
Mr Slave
Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?
Paris Hilton
Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already.
Various Teen Girls
Ooooo!
Annie Knitts
Wow, what a bitch. [smiles]
Mr Slave
Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.
Paris Hilton
Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!
Various Teen Girls
Ooooo!
Men
[popping up out of nowhere] Whore-off! Whore-off!
Official
Ah, testing? Hello? [taps the mic a few times] Okay uh, welcome everyone. Uh, the South Park Chamber of Commerce is pleased to bring you the first annual "Who Is The Biggest Whore" showdown. [the crowd cheers]
Bebe Stevens
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
Red
Paris is gonna rock his world.
Official
Ah, I'm... not quite sure how we... start this competition off, but uh-
Paris Hilton
[gets off her chair and walks over to the mic] I'll show ya how we start it off. [the music starts and she kisses him hard and grabbing his crotch]
Crowd
Ohhh! [the girls are grinning, Wendy looks at the girls' reactions. Paris then has five men on stage with her, and one of them is licking her leg. Mr. Slave simply observes]
Wendy Testaburger
[approaches Stan and friends, and Mr. Garrison] What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.
Herbert Garrison
Give him time, Wendy. Give him time. [cheers him on softly] Come on, Mr. Slave.
Paris Hilton
[throws the men off] Back off! None of you losers are enough for me! [whips out a pineapple from behind her back and stuffs it up her vagina] Eeeaaagh. Oh yeah. Aaaargh. [some gasps] Tada! [the crowd cheers and fireworks go off]
Randy Marsh
Oh, no she di'int. [the crowd continues cheering]
Mr Slave
[dusts himself off and coughs] Jesus. [takes off his pants and takes a running leap towards Paris. He lands on her head and proceeds to swallow her up through his ass, with each swallow accompanied by a grunt. The first swallow takes her head; the second, her chest; the third, her abdomen and lower back; and the fourth takes the rest of her body.] Ohoho, Jesus. [the girls are stunned at what they just saw. The adults, the boys, and Wendy all cheer]
Herbert Garrison
Now, that's a whore! [Stan and friends are still stunned. Mr. Slave goes back to his chair and puts on his pants]
Bebe Stevens
Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.
Mr Slave
People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore. [the crowd falls silent] Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the- [feels something in his stomach] ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.
Mr Stevens
The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe, you're going to dress like a little girl. [the crowd disperses and the girls walk up to Wendy]
Bebe Stevens
Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
Red
Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore.
Wendy Testaburger
That's okay, you guys. [Butters and his family are shown next]
Stephen Stotch
So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!
Butters Stotch
[turns right and walks away] I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
Stephen Stotch
You're a grounded old bear.
Paris Hilton
Oh my God, it's so gross! Let me out of here! [a light comes on in front of her - it's the Frog King] What the fuck is that?
Frog King
Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die.
Paris Hilton
What?
Frog King
Make your way to the small intestine. There you will meet the Sparrow Prince, who can guide you to Catatafish. Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste! [disappears]
Singers
[End of Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset. Some singers sing the following song as Paris begins her journey:] Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton Stupid whore!
